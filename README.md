# Trees

- This repository contains my solution to Springboard exercise 47.8.9.
- In this exercise, I was tasked with implementing methods on both a tree and binary tree class.
  - Some of the methods include:
    - Counting all the nodes in a tree with even values.
    - Finding the length of the shortest/longest path in a tree.
- Check out ***binary-tree.js*** and ***tree.js*** to see all of the instance methods that I created for these classes.

## Testing

- First run:

  ```bash
  npm i
  ```

- Then run:

  ```bash
  jest --verbose binary-tree.test.js
  ```
  
  ```bash
  jest --verbose tree.test.js
  ```
